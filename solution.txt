solution:

The key difference between git stash pop and apply involves the stash history.
When a developer uses the git stash apply command, the most recently saved stash overwrites files in the current working tree but leaves the stash history alone. In contrast, the pop command restores files but then deletes the applied stash. 
If a developer ever feels the need to use that restored stash again, it will be saved in the local file system.

Think of the git stash pop command as a two-step process. It pulls the most recent stash from history, makes the appropriate changes to files in the local workspace and then deletes that entry from the stash history. Once the git stash pop command is successfully invoked, the stash is permanently deleted and can never be accessed again.-
